      <h3>Story Ending One</h3>
      <p>One scorching hot day, my mother had decided to open all of the windows and doors with the intention of saving money
        on the air conditioning. Fortunately, every door and window in our house was reinforced by a screen door, which
        kept our dog, Tofu, from escaping. Escaping wasn't a concern until today, especially with this intense heat wave, which made my mother, father, and I
        extremely fatigued and scatter-brained. I was usually the one to let Tofu out to take occassional bathroom breaks and walks throughout the day, so my
        parents left that duty to me. With that in mind, they decided to rest in their bedroom and ended up in deep sleep until night fell.
        As they slept, I was playing with Tofu and keeping myself busy, while trying my best to stay cool. And as expected, this didn't last
        very long. In a couple of hours, I had given in to the heat induced tiredness. I remember falling asleep on the couch around 2 PM and the next
        thing I knew, I was abruptly woken up at 7 PM by my mother asking where Tofu was. He had gotten out of through the back door! We checked to see if the
        screen door material had been chewed up, but the door was completely open. The heat had caused the door frame to expand and the lock undid itself.
        My parents and I rushed outside with flashlights and began calling for him. Our town wasn't very populated, but there were massive areas of land surrounding
        us. After 3 hours of frantically searching and alerting the neighbors, we decided to head back home with the hopes that Tofu had returned.
        To our disappointment, we came home without any sign of Tofu's return. We were all so tired and decided we would look again tomorrow. Tomorrow came and
        he never showed up. It took 4 years before we adopted a new dog, but I'll never forget Tofu, the dog that I grew up with.

        very long and in a couple of hours, I had given in to the heat induced tiredness. I woke up a little bit over 30 minutes later and realized that
        Tofu had gotten out. I ran outside dreading that he had been hit by a car or no where to be seen. However, a voice from next door had summoned me. It was
        our neighbor, Mrs. Jones, and in her arms was Tofu. She had seen home wander outside and luckily, she took him inside and watched him until I
        realized he was gone.
