    <h1>PT Sans</h1>
    <br>

    <h2>Origins</h2>
    <p>PT Sans, released in 2009, was designed by Alexandra Korolkova, Olga Umpeleva, and Vladimir Yefimov from Paratype, a company that develops and distributes
      multilingual typefaces that support the Latin, Cyrillic, Greek, Arabic, Hebrew, Armenian, and Georgian scripts.
      PT Sans was developed for the project "Public Types of Russian Federation." The main aim of the project is to
      give possibility to the people of Russia to read and write in their native languages. PT Sans is based on Russian sans
      serif types of the second part of the 20th century, but at the same time has distinctive features of contemporary humanistic designs.
      The project is dedicated to the 300 year anniversary of the civil type invented by Peter the Great in 1708â€“1710.

    <h2>Usage</h2>
    <p>
      This font is mainly used on road signs, general signage, hoardings,
      and other communication design objects in the urban environment. This style has increased readability when viewed from
      an acute angle or from a long distance, in low-light conditions, in fog, on luminescent and reflective signs, with backlighting, etc.
      What we liked about this font was that it is a comprehensive type that combines traditional conservative appearances with modern trends of humanistic
      san serifs. It's also legible on all mediums and can be used in a variety of industries. Overall, it's a very neutral font with a soft touch that is
      easily readible.
