      <h2>Transportation Services Mobile App Development</h2>
      <img src="./blogimages/limebike-app.jpg" alt= "header" style="width:100%;">
      <p> In order to ensure a pleasant experience using transportation services, hours of time and effort must go into
         developing an intuitive and functional mobile app. The three main pioneers of e-scooter and bike
         transportation services are Bird, Spin, and Limebike. All transportation service mobile apps have the
          same basic model that includes activation, gps tracking, in-app payment, and deactivation. However,
           each one of these services has its own mobile app that works a little differently depending on the company
           and how its service functions.
      </p>

      <p>
        For example, Bird, has created its own mobile app that is specifically designed to make renting an e-scooter easy and
        convenient with a tap of the finger and barcode scan. The Bird e-scooter service mobile app processing system consists
         of seven steps, which include how to find and unlock, start, foot placement, where to ride, brakes, parking, and how
         to end the ride. These steps are relatively the same for alternative e-scooter and bike services.
      </p>

      <p>
        Inspired by these preexisting electric transport apps, many startups in this industry are using the same basic model to
         create their own versions. The essential elements needed to make a successful and usable e-transport mobile app include
          a way to locate and activate the vehicle, barcode scanning feature, safe security and locking system, and safety guide.
          In addition, mobile app developers must take into consideration how to create an organized and specific location tracking
          system and evade urban traffic.
      </p>
      <p>
      As far as design elements for these mobile apps, many companies are leaning toward a clean and minimal user interface.
      Theyâ€™re focused more on functionality, organization of information, and user-experience, thus keeping the visual designs
      limited. Many mobile app developers go through the general process of researching and identifying problems to conquer,
      creating personas, testing user flows, sketching possible designs, putting together a general wireframe, user testing,
      and finally, prototyping.
