      <h2>Transportation Services Mobile App Development</h2>
      <p> In order to ensure a pleasant experience using transportation services, hours of time and effort must go into
         developing an intuitive and functional mobile app. The three main pioneers of e-scooter and bike
         transportation services are Bird, Spin, and Limebike. All transportation service mobile apps have the
          same basic model that includes activation, gps tracking, in-app payment, and deactivation. However,
           each one of these services has its own mobile app that works a little differently depending on the company
           and how it functions.
      </p>

      <p>
        For example, Bird, has created its own mobile app that is specifically designed to make renting a scooter easy and convenient with a scan of a barcode.
         The Bird onboarding process consists of seven steps, which include how to find and unlock, start, foot placement, where
         to ride, brakes, parking, and ending the ride.
