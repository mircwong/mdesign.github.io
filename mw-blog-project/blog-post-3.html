      <h2>A Deeper Look Into Mobile Onboarding Design</h2>
      <p>
         When designing a mobile app for e-transport systems, the designer must be conscious of functionality as well as
        design aesthetics. Bike and scooter sharing service apps all follow the most basic design pattern: a splash screen,
         sign-up form, terms and conditions page, and a how-to-use tutorial. This on-boarding screenflow forms the foundation
         of e-transport mobile app development and the designer builds the rest of the app off of this in alignment with
         the company’s look and feel.
      </p>

      <p>
        Regarding design aesthetics and user-interface layouts, designers have been gravitating toward minimal, flat
        design icons and graphics. In addition, responsive and interactive pages are much more preferred over static
        ones because it keeps the user stimulated and engaged with the app. It is also important that the design style
        is consistent throughout and align well with the company’s brand image.
      </p>

      <p>
        Although visuals are important, if the app lacks functionality, users are less likely to continue using it.
        Maneuvering through basic screenflow causes great frustration for the user if not done correctly. The designer
         must ensure that the sign-up process is not too lengthy or the user will abandon the app simply because it takes
        up too much of their time. In addition, having a walkthrough tutorial right up front is a huge mobile on-boarding
        mistake. By doing this, the designer is actually keeping the user from using the app, which is the whole point of
         creating the app in the first place. Instead, these tutorials should be optional and the app’s design should be
         intuitive. The whole point of mobile app development is to satisfy the user and make difficult processes more
        efficient and convenient. The goal of the designer is to help the user navigate through the app and fulfill their
        needs as quickly and streamlined as possible. Yes, it’s important to that company meets revenue goals, but confusing
         flows and user interfaces will deter long-term customer loyalties. What designers have learned through examining
        and using e-transport service apps is that the customer’s needs must always be put first and the app should be
          designed assuming that everyone is a first-time user.
