      <h2>An Introduction to Electric Transportation</h2>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>In the past few years, commuters have transitioned over to electric transportation services. Ride-sharing giants,
        like Uber and Lyft, have answered this high demand by creating their own bike and scooter rental
        services. Not far behind, startups like Bird and Spin have also joined the game hoping to dominate the industry
        and are working to improve urban sustainability.
      </p>

      <p>
        Through mobile app development, these companies are establishing themselves as primary electric transportation services.
        Without even lifting a muscle, commuters can easily open the company's app and rent a bike or scooter, get to where
        they need to be, tap a few buttons on their smartphones, and be on their way.
      </p>

      <p>
        The advantages of using these new modes
        of transportation are that they are convenient, easily accessible, relatively quick, affordable, and reliable. In addition, integration of these
        transportation services into metropolitan and suburban areas limit urban congestion and emissions that contribute to smog and climate change.
        They also allow for alternative fuel sources to be fully and efficiently utilized.
      </p>

      <p>
        While there are many benefits that come along with this mode of transportation, there are some problems that arise. The industryâ€™s profitability
         is dependent on weather conditions, meaning that during winter or in colder areas, people are less likely to be using these services.
         There is also the issue of safety in busy cities and not having enough designated parking areas.
      </p>
      <p>
        This industry is becoming more and more popular and prevalent in metropolitan areas. It is a bit too early to predict whether or not this is
        the future of all transportation, but it is a revolutionary outbreak. Many people are pushing toward updating infrastructure to design for
        safer and more pleasant commutes by developing protected lanes, charging stations, and parking areas for electric transportation services.
