      <h2>An Introduction to Electric Transportation</h2>
      <p><i class="fas fa-bicycle"></i></p>
      <p>

        In the past few years, commuters have transitioned over to electric transportation services. Ride-sharing giants,
        like Uber and Lyft, have answered this high demand by creating their own bike and scooter rental
        services. Not far behind, startups like Bird and Spin have also joined the game hoping to dominate the industry
        and are working to improve urban sustainability.

      <h2>Transportation Services Mobile App Development</h2>
      <p><i class="fas fa-bicycle"></i></p>
      <p>In order to ensure a pleasant experience using transportation services, hours of time and effort must go into
         developing an intuitive and functional mobile app. The three main pioneers of e-scooter and bike
         transportation services are Bird, Spin, and Limebike. All transportation service mobile apps have the
          same basic model that includes activation, gps tracking, in-app payment, and deactivation. However,
           each one of these services has its own mobile app that works a little differently depending on the company
           and how its service functions.

      <h2>A Deeper Look Into Mobile Onboarding Design</h2>
      <p><i class="fas fa-bicycle"></i></p>
      <p>When designing a mobile app for e-transport systems, the designer must be conscious of functionality as well as
     design aesthetics. Bike and scooter sharing service apps all follow the most basic design pattern: a splash screen,
      sign-up form, terms and conditions page, and a how-to-use tutorial. This on-boarding screenflow forms the foundation
      of e-transport mobile app development and the designer builds the rest of the app off of this in alignment with
      the company’s look and feel.
